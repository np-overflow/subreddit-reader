# Android with Kotlin Workshop
This GitHub repository contains a template project to start you off for the workshop. Code for the layouts and RecyclerView are given, though it is an essential skill to be able to create them yourself.

A `http` module and `parser` module are given. The `http` module provides code to perform GET requests. The `parser` module parses JSON to `Post` data objects.

## Branches
There are two branches, `master` and `complete`. The `complete` is what your app should look like (or at least similar) at the end of the workshop. Note that although [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) are used in the project, they will not be taught (unless we have time).

The workshop slides will be released after the workshop.
